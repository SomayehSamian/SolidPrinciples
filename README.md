# SOLID Principles Project

This project is a simple example to demonstrate the implementation of SOLID principles in software design.

## SOLID Principles

SOLID is a set of five principles in object-oriented programming:
- **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change.
- **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality.
- **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** A client should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Implementation

In this project, we have written different classes. At first, 
I created the class without following these design principles,
then for each class, we display the corresponding class based on SOLID principles.
With character - For example, we have a 'UserCreator' class that follows the single responsibility principle and only handles user-related functions. whose modified form can
be used in a class called S-UserCreator
